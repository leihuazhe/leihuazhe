## Hey there! 👋 

🧑‍💻 I'm a seasoned software engineer with 9 years of experiences, specializing in backend development. I have a knack for Java, Scala, and various backend technologies. With a solid foundation in middleware and networking, I've honed my craft as a senior development engineer in the infrastructure department.

🌏 Currently based in China, I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities, whether it's through relocation for cross-border positions or remote work arrangements. 
I'm passionate about backend development and thrive on delivering top-notch solutions that drive business growth.
If you're in need of a dedicated backend developer to join your team, let's chat! Together, we can create something extraordinary! 🚀

Here are some of the open-source projects I've contributed to:
- [Dapeng-SOA](http://github.com/dapeng-soa/dapeng-soa/) - A lightweight, high performance micro-service framework
